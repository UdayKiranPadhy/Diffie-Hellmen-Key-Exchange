# Diffie-Hellmen-Key-Exchange
Ok, I was studying my examination and I got bored memorising the rotten things And then I saw this Diffie Hellmen Key Exchange Method and understand how this works .
I have also included a video for understanding in the assets folder , feel free to fork or submit a pull request to the repositatory .

I wrote a simple python script to derive secret keys for both Alice and Bob based on the video.


This is the code for the key exchange method

```
import random

# g and p values agreed by both Alice and Bob.
g = random.randint(0,10)
p = random.randint(10,20)
print(f"Alice and Bob Agreed to g {g} and mod number p {p}")

#Alice chose a random number between p to 100
Alice_private_number = random.randint(p,100)
print(f'Alice Private Number generated by random number is {Alice_private_number}')

#Bob chose a random number between p to 100
Bob_private_number = random.randint(p,100)
print(f'Bob Private Number generated by random number is {Bob_private_number}')

#Public Value of Alice to be sent to Bob
a = g**Alice_private_number % p
print(f"Alice's calculated public value is {a}, which will be sent to Bob publicly.\n")

# public value of Bob's to be sent over to Alice.
b = g**Bob_private_number % p
print(f"Bob's calculated public value is {b}, which will be sent over to Alice publicly.\n")


# Alice uses Bob's public value and her private value to compute the secret key.
secret_key1 = b**Alice_private_number % p

# Bob uses Alice's public value and his private value to compute the secret key.
secret_key2 = a**Bob_private_number % p

if secret_key1 == secret_key2:
    print("Secret key has been successfully derived! See below...\n")
    print(f"Bob uses Alice's public value which is {a}, and his own private value which is {Bob_private_number}, "
          f"the secret key is {secret_key2}.\n")
    print(f"Alice uses Bob's public value which is {b}, and her own private random value which is {Alice_private_number},"
          f"the secret key is {secret_key1}.")
else:
    print("Alice and Bob have different secret keys, which is wrong! Try again!")

```
